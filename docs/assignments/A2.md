# Assignment 2

## Application Goals:
- Name: SafeCircle
- Description: Young professionals who have recently moved to a new city and want to expand their social network by meeting new people in person, but have safety concerns about connecting with strangers.  
- Value it will bring: 
SafeCircle offers a secure and trustworthy platform that goes beyond existing social apps by providing safey features such as verified identities, public event promotion, event buddy system, real-time safety features. By addressing the common safety concerns associated with meeting new people, SafeCircle empowers users to confidently build new friendships and integrate into their community.

## Comparables:

1. Meetup's Event Discovery Interface

Description:
Meetup's homepage displays a grid of upcoming events with images, titles, dates, and brief descriptions. Users can filter events by category, date, and distance from their location.

Design Inspiration:
The visual layout of events makes it easy for users to browse and find activities that interest them. For SafeCircle, adopting a similar interface could make event discovery more engaging and user-friendly. Incorporating filters specific to safety features—such as "verified events" or "public spaces only"—could enhance trust.

2. Nextdoor's Neighborhood Verification

Description:
Nextdoor requires users to verify their address through mail or phone to ensure they are actual residents of the neighborhood. The platform then connects them to a community of nearby neighbors.

Design Inspiration:
SafeCircle could use location verification to connect users within specific neighborhoods or areas, enhancing the sense of local community and trust among users who are verified residents.

3. Facebook Groups' Event Discussion Threads

Description:
In Facebook Groups, each event has its own discussion thread where members can comment, ask questions, and interact before the event takes place.

Design Inspiration:
Implementing pre-event discussion boards in SafeCircle could help users engage with one another, alleviate concerns, and build rapport before meeting in person, contributing to a safer and more comfortable experience.

4. Eventbrite's Ticketing and Check-In System
![pic](/../assets/images/A2/eventbrite.jpg)

Description:
Eventbrite provides digital tickets for events and has a check-in system for organizers to manage attendee lists and track participation.

Design Inspiration:
SafeCircle could incorporate a digital check-in feature that not only manages attendance but also adds a layer of security by knowing who is present at each event. This could be tied to verified identities to ensure all attendees are who they claim to be.

5. LinkedIn's Professional Endorsements

Description:
LinkedIn allows users to endorse each other's skills and write recommendations, adding credibility to profiles.

Design Inspiration:
SafeCircle could include a system where users can vouch for each other's reliability and friendliness after attending events together, building a trustworthy community through peer endorsements.

6. Uber's Real-Time Location Sharing

Description:
Uber allows users to share their trip status and real-time location with trusted contacts directly from the app.

Design Inspiration:
SafeCircle could integrate a "Share My Location" feature during events, enabling users to share their whereabouts with friends or family members, thereby enhancing personal safety when meeting new people.

7. Tinder's Photo Verification

Description:
Tinder offers a photo verification process where users take real-time selfies mimicking poses to confirm their identity, earning a verification badge on their profile.

Design Inspiration:
Incorporating a similar photo verification in SafeCircle would add an extra layer of identity confirmation without requiring sensitive personal information, addressing privacy concerns while enhancing trust.

## VSD analysis

1. Observation (Stakeholders - Marginalized/Vulnerable Stakeholders):

(a) The "Verified Identity Badges" (Feature 1), requiring government ID verification, may exclude individuals without access to official identification, such as undocumented immigrants or those from marginalized communities, limiting their ability to participate.

(b) Design Response: Introduce alternative verification methods, like community endorsements (Feature 8) or verification through trusted community organizations, to include a broader range of users while maintaining safety standards.

2. Observation (Values - Privacy Concerns):

(a) Features like "Real-Time Location Sharing" (Feature 4) and "Safe Arrival Alerts" (Feature 16) could infringe on user privacy by exposing sensitive location data, leading to potential misuse or discomfort among users wary of constant monitoring.

(b) Design Response: Implement strict privacy controls allowing users to customize who can access their location information, make these features optional, and ensure all data is encrypted and only shared with designated trusted contacts.

3. Observation (Time - Long-Term Social Impact):

(a) Over time, the "SafeCircle Trust Score" (Feature 11) could create social stratification, stigmatizing users with lower scores and impacting their ability to engage with the community, leading to exclusion and decreased diversity.

(b) Design Response: Shift the focus from a numerical score to highlighting positive feedback and endorsements without aggregating them into a public score, promoting inclusivity and reducing the risk of negative long-term effects.

4. Observation (Pervasiveness - Misuse of Reporting System):

(a) If widely adopted, the "Anonymous Reporting System" (Feature 14) might be misused for false or malicious reports, unjustly damaging reputations and eroding trust within the community.

(b) Design Response: Establish a robust moderation process for reports, involving human reviewers or a community review panel to verify claims before action is taken, balancing anonymity with fairness and preventing abuse.

5. Observation (Stakeholders - Impact on Small Businesses):

(a) The "Public Venue Filter" (Feature 3) emphasizing well-known venues may inadvertently exclude smaller local businesses, affecting their opportunities to host events and engage with the community.

(b) Design Response: Develop a vetting and support system for safe, smaller venues to be included, offering guidelines to meet safety standards, thus supporting local businesses and enriching event diversity.

6. Observation (Time - Blurring Professional Boundaries):

(a) Over time, "Integration with Professional Networks" (Feature 18) might blur personal and professional boundaries, potentially leading to unintended consequences in users' careers or professional relationships.

(b) Design Response: Provide users with control over how their professional information is displayed and who can view it, offering options to keep professional profiles separate or anonymous within the app to maintain desired boundaries.

7. Observation (Values - Inclusion of Diverse Interests):

(a) "Interest-Based Event Recommendations" (Feature 6) might inadvertently create echo chambers, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and excluding those with niche or less common interests.

(b) Design Response: Design the recommendation algorithm to promote a variety of events, including both popular and niche interests, and feature events aimed at bringing diverse groups together to foster inclusivity.
