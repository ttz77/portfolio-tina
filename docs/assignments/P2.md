# Phase 2


## Broad Application Goals




Our app is called **Enlighten**, and it's for beginners in stargazing. Getting into stargazing can be overwhelming and we hope to create an app that will create a community for beginners and lead them to recognize the importance of light pollution and its impact on the environment.




## **Scrapbook of comparables.**




### Star Walk 2

                     <figcaption></figcaption>
                 </figure>


- Snapchat users can submit their snaps to snap map. Their profile shows up on the map, and when clicked, other users can see their snap that they took at that location.
- How it might be useful: Users can submit the night sky at a specific location and time, and their posts will show up on the map if approved.


## **Brainstorming features**


1. Map: The app will provide a light pollution heatmap so users can see how light pollution varies between different locations.
2. Feed: Users can post “Sky Observations” which show up in a chronological feed and/or the light pollution heatmap.

## Outlining App


- **Mapping:**
   - Purpose: Provide a map display where users can zoom in/out on the map and view user-uploaded information based on location.
   - Operational principle: User zooms into map, finds a location, and clicks on it to view user-uploaded information and light pollution statistics specific to that location.
- **Listing**:
   - Purpose: Provide a feed of sky observations in a convenient scrollable format with customizable filters.
   - Operational principle: As the user scrolls through the feed, new sky observations that are close to the user’s location appear. Users can choose to filter sky observations based on location.
- **Forums**:
   - Purpose: To bring together communities with similar astronomy-based interests which will be useful to introducing beginners into astronomy.
   - Operational principle: Users look at other users’ messages and can reply or add a message for a new topic.
- **Tracking**:
   - Purpose: Shows users what space objects (stars, planets, comets, satellites, etc..) are viewable from certain locations.
   - Operational Principle: Users can click a tab which will bring them to a list of observable space objects and clicking on a space object will give the user updated information about its current location and tips on how to spot it.
- **Rewarding:**
   - Purpose: Reward and boost users that make frequent, high-quality posts so that beginner users know of experienced users to reach out to.
   - Operational Principle: Based on the frequency of the posts and the number of likes, users can earn badges beside their names, which show up next to their names when they post.
