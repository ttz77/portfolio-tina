## Heuristic Evaluation

### Usability Criteria
Discoverability
- The buttons on the bottom navigation bar have both icons that are commonly seen in apps so a first time user can easily navigate through the app. An addition is to color the buttons, so they are all easy to find. 

Efficiency
- The most used pages are quickly accessible by the bottom navigation bar. The buttons also do not change formats, so they can be used efficiently to navigate through the app. 

### Physical heuristics
Fitt's Law
- The "Create an event" button is large and in the middle of the page, so it is easy to click on.
- For the page listing events, it may be beneficial to increase the size of the boxes for each event so that they are easier to read.

Gestalt Principles
- For the profile page, there could be more space to separate between the verifications and the endorsements, since these are two separate concepts. I chose to show the endorsements on the page where you can endorse users to keep the features in one concept together. However, a trade off is that finding your own endorsements is harder to find. 

### Linguistic level
Consistency
- The pink colors are related to creating and posting an event. The purple colors are related to joining and leaving events. Red colors are for actions that delete, such as deleting an event or deleting your profile.
- The icons used are also consistent with other apps. 

Information scent
- The pages are formatted to be read from top to bottom, which is the natural direction someone reads a page. 
- Buttons are consistently in one place and are colored and easy to find.
