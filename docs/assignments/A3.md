## Functional Design

The dependency diagram of the concepts in my app is below:
![pic](/../assets/images/A3/dependency.jpeg)

### Concept 1: Authenticating 

Purpose: Allow users to securely register and verify their identities.

Operational Principle: After a user logs in with valid credentials, they can authenticate and access their account.

Actions:
```
registerUser(username: String, password: String) -> UserID
authenticateUser(username: String, password: String) -> Boolean
logoutUser(userID: String)
getCurrentAuthenticatedUser() -> User or null
 ```

State:
```
Users: Set<User>
Credentials: Mapping<UserID, {username, password, email}>
 ```

### Concept 2: Sessioning

Purpose: Allow users to stay authenticated in their account across different pages until they choose to log out.

Operational Principle: After a user logs in, a session is created to keep them authenticated. The session persists until the user logs out or the session expires due to inactivity.

Actions:
```
startSession(userID: String) -> sessionID: String
endSession(sessionID: String)
getSessionUser(sessionID: String) -> UserID or null
isSessionActive(sessionID: String) -> Boolean
 ```

State:
```
Sessions: Mapping<SessionID, {UserID, ExpiryTime}>
 ```

### Concept 3: Verifying Identity

Purpose: Enable users to verify their identities to establish trust within the community.

Operational Principle: After a user completes the verification process, their account is marked as verified, indicating to others that their identity has been confirmed.

Actions:
```
submitVerification(userID: String, verificationData: VerificationData)
approveVerification(userID: String)
rejectVerification(userID: String)
getVerificationStatus(userID: String) -> VerificationStatus
 ```

State:
```
VerificationStatus: Mapping {userID} -> {verified, unverified}.
 ```

### Concept 4: Posting 
Purpose: Allow users to create and share items that others can view.

Operational Principle: After a user creates a post, the post becomes available for other users to discover and interact with.

Actions:
```
createPost(userID: String, item: Item) -> postID: String
deletePost(userID: String, postID: String)
editPost(userID: String, postID: String, newItem: Item)
viewPosts(filters: PostFilters) -> Set<Post>
getPostByID(postID: String) -> Post
 ```

 State:
```
Posts: Set<Post>
PostDetails: Mapping<PostID, Item>
 ```

### Concept 5: Joining 
Purpose: Allow participants to join activities they are interested in.

Operational Principle: After a user joins an activity, they are added to the participant list and can engage with others involved in the activity.

Actions:
```
joinActivity(userID: String, activityID: String)
leaveActivity(userID: String, activityID: String)
getParticipants(activityID: String) -> Set<UserID>
 ```

 State:
```
ActivityParticipants: Mapping<ActivityID, Set<UserID>>
 ```

### Concept 6: Endorsing
Purpose: Allow users to provide feedback about other users to build trust within the community.
(Build community trust through user endorsements after events.)

Operational Principle: After a user endorses another user, the endorsement is recorded and visible to others.

Actions:
```
giveEndorsement(endorserID: String, endorsedID: String, endorsementText: String)
viewEndorsements(userID: String) -> Set<Endorsement>
 ```

State:
```
Endorsements: Mapping<UserID, Set<Endorsement>>
 ```

### Concept 7: Location Sharing 
Purpose: Allow users to share their real-time location with trusted contacts.

Operational Principle: When a user enables location sharing, their real-time location is shared with selected contacts until they disable it.

Actions:
```
enableLocationSharing(userID: String, contacts: Set<Contact>)
disableLocationSharing(userID: String)
getLocation(userID: String) -> Location or null
 ```

State:
```
LocationSharingStatus: Mapping<UserID, {enabled, disabled}>
TrustedContacts: Mapping<UserID, Set<Contact>>
CurrentLocations: Mapping<UserID, Location>
 ```

### Synchronizations 

User Registration, Verification, and Session Initiation:
 ```
 sync registerVerifyAndLogin(username: String, password: String, email: String, verificationMethod: VerificationMethod):
    
    // Register the user
    Authenticating.registerUser(username, password, email)
    userID = Authenticating.getUserID(username)
    
    // Submit identity verification
    IdentityVerification.submitVerification(userID, verificationMethod)
    
    // Assume verification is approved immediately for simplicity
    IdentityVerification.approveVerification(userID)
    
    // Authenticate the user
    isAuthenticated = Authenticating.authenticateUser(username, password)
    if not isAuthenticated:
        throw Error("Authentication failed after registration.")
    
    // Start a session for the user
    sessionID = SessionManagement.startSession(userID)
    
    return sessionID
  ```
Creating and Joining an Event:
  ```
  sync createAndJoinEvent(sessionID: String, eventInfo: EventInfo) -> EventID:
    
    // Check if session is active
    if not SessionManagement.isSessionActive(sessionID):
        throw Error("User session is not active.")
    
    // Get the user associated with the session
    userID = SessionManagement.getSessionUser(sessionID)
    
    // Ensure the user is verified
    if IdentityVerification.getVerificationStatus(userID) != verified:
        throw Error("Only verified users can create events.")
    
    // Create the event
    postID = Posting.createPost(userID, eventInfo)
    eventID = postID // Assuming each event is a post
    
    // User joins the event as the host
    Joining.joinActivity(userID, eventID)
    
    return eventID
  ```
Using Real-Time Safety Features During an Event:
  ```
  sync enableSafetyFeatures(sessionID: String, eventID: String, trustedContacts: Set<Contact>):
    
    // Check if session is active
    if not SessionManagement.isSessionActive(sessionID):
        throw Error("User session is not active.")
    
    // Get the user associated with the session
    userID = SessionManagement.getSessionUser(sessionID)
    
    // Enable location sharing with trusted contacts
    LocationSharing.enableLocationSharing(userID, trustedContacts)
    
    // Schedule periodic safety check-ins
    Scheduler.scheduleSafetyCheckIns(userID, eventID, interval=30 minutes)
    
    return Success

  ```

  Give and view endorsements:
  ```
  sync giveAndViewEndorsement(sessionID: String, endorsedUserID: String, eventID: String, endorsementText: String):
    
    // Check if session is active
    if not SessionManagement.isSessionActive(sessionID):
        throw Error("User session is not active.")
    
    // Get the endorser user
    endorserID = SessionManagement.getSessionUser(sessionID)
    
    // Ensure both users attended the same event
    if not (endorserID in Joining.getParticipants(eventID) and endorsedUserID in Joining.getParticipants(eventID)):
        throw Error("Both users must have attended the event to endorse.")
    
    // Submit the endorsement
    Endorsing.giveEndorsement(endorserID, endorsedUserID, endorsementText)
    
    // Optionally, notify the endorsed user
    Notifications.notifyUser(endorsedUserID, "You have received a new endorsement from " + endorserID)
    
    return Success
  ```

## Design Tradeoffs

1. Level of Verification Required

Issue: Determining the appropriate level of identity verification to ensure safety without excluding users.

Options:

(a) Strict Verification (Government ID only): Highest security but may exclude users uncomfortable with sharing sensitive documents.

(b) Flexible Verification Methods: Including options like social media accounts for verification.

Decision:
Chose Flexible Verification Methods to balance security and user comfort, allowing more users to participate while maintaining trust.

2. Level of Detail in Event Information
Issue: Determining the appropriate amount of information to display about events, specifically regarding the visibility of the participant list, to balance transparency, user privacy, and community trust.

Options:

(a) Fully Public Participant Lists

(b) Restricted Participant Lists - Limits the visibility of participants to those who are directly involved and have opted-in to share own information.

(c) No Participant Lists (Complete Privacy)

Chose Option B: Restricted Participant Lists to balance transparency and user privacy effectively. By allowing users to control who can view their participation, the app respects individual privacy preferences while still enabling networking and trust-building among participants.

3. Privacy vs. Safety in Location Sharing

Issue: Balancing the usefulness of real-time location sharing with user privacy concerns.

Options:

(a) Mandatory Location Sharing during Events: Ensures maximum safety but infringes on privacy.

(b) Optional Location Sharing with User Control: Users decide when and with whom to share their location.
Decision:

Selected Optional Location Sharing with User Control to respect user autonomy and privacy, providing safety features without being intrusive.
