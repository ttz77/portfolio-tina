## Draft Impact Case
1. The problem of light pollution is important because it can negatively interfere with animals’ biological clocks and it prevents people from being able to see constellations, comets, etc. Secondarily, it also contributes to unnecessary energy consumption and carbon emissions. 
2. Our solution to address this problem is to build an app to raise awareness, track areas with high levels of light pollution, provide resources to learn more about light pollution, and connect people with initiatives to reduce light pollution.
3. We believe these are good solutions because in our experience, light pollution isn’t taken very seriously by the general population and isn’t acknowledged much in policy. Raising awareness and increasing involvement in the movement to reduce light pollution are currently the best steps to reduce light pollution.
4. We could measure user engagement metrics, polls from the community to prove that our app is a good solution to light pollution.

## Interview roles and potential interviewees:

Animal Researcher - someone who would care about light pollution from an environmental or animal behavior standpoint 

General public - people who are not directly involved

Observatory staff + ARCLab staff - someone who would care about light pollution for stargazing and astronomy

## VSD Analysis

### Direct Stakeholders
- Residents in high-light pollution areas
    - They are directly impacted by light pollution in their daily lives and would use the app to look for resources to mitigate effects on their health or for educational resources
    - They might want to see information specific to their local area, and a space to connect with their community to discuss guidelines on reducing light pollution
- Students and teachers
    - Teachers may use the app as an educational resource in an environmental science class
    - Interactive content and explanations would help students be engaged while using the app
- Other direct stakeholders would include local government representatives, people interested in stargazing or other nighttime activities, or people interested in raising environmental awareness

### Consider children
- Since one of the direct stakeholders we are considering include children, we should make sure to consider how the app would influence a child’s social and moral development. Here is a scenario of a seven-year old interacting with the app:
- Mia, a curious seven-year-old, opens the app and starts exploring. She sees a map on the front page, and looks for her neighborhood on it. She notices that the label says her city is very bright, and wants to know what that means for the animals that live in her neighborhood. She moves onto the next page that explains the environmental impact of light pollution. She plays an interactive game that helps her develop an early awareness of enviornmental issues and what she can do in her daily life to reduce light pollution.

### Diverse geographies
- In rural areas, light pollution would be very low so the users would have less concern about local light pollution, instead they would use the app to upload images of clear night skys in the community board, so that other users can see the contrast between the night skies in the cities and the rural areas. They could also provide tips for stargazing time and locations.
- In urban areas, users would want to find actionable insights on the app to do their own part in making a difference in the area. Thus, the app would connect them with the community by providing links to urban lighting policies or government initiatives.

### Widespread Use
- Synergistic benefits
    - Collective data: as more people use the app, we can gather more user uploaded data on how their neighborhood is affected by light pollution. With thousands of users contributing their own observations, the app can provide real-time local data and have our own light pollution trends instead of using an external dataset that we plan to do in our initial stage.
    - Community engagement: users can organize events like “turn lights off at 12/7 9pm” or push for city-wide change.
    - Dark sky locations for stargazing: users can find low-pollution spots worldwide for people interested in stargazing, supporting eco-tourism.
- Breakdowns
    - Data overload: with images being uploaded constantly, the app may struggle to handle the images and load it onto the page
    - Data misinformation: mantaining the quality of community interactions might become challenging and some people might disagree on light pollution topics, where moderation could become difficult.
    - Privacy concern: since users are encouraged to actively upload images onto the community page with their location, that might lead to privacy issues.

### Choose Desired Values
- Community: Include features that enable users to connect with local communities like discussion forums or stargazing image upload, or nieghborhood-based challenges to reduce light pollution. This would help encourage collaboration between the users.
- Ownership: Have a user-specific profile page where they can customize their app experience, such as tracking their individual contributions to light pollution reduction.
- Environmental Sustainability: promote user behavior that support long-term reduction of light pollution and preservation of dark night skies. We plan to include educational resources and actionable steps that users can follow to reduce light pollution in thier dailiy lives.


## Interview Plans and Key Lessons

### Hunch: 
Many people are not as aware of issues surrounding light pollution. Perhaps it is possible to make people more aware of these issues, and consequently incentivise people to actually care about this issue. In these interviews, we will gauge awareness of light pollution and if we can actually manage to get people to care.

### Summary of Interviews:
We conducted interviews on four different interviewees. One participant was an astronomer at Wellesley College, while the remaining three were members of the general public.

#### General Perception:
- Common Understanding: Most interviewees accepted light pollution as a part of living in an urban environment. They tend to not think of light pollution as much of a severe problem as other pollution types. They were aware of potential environmental consequences, however they were not as severe as other types of pollution.
- Impact Perception: People tend to be aware of the effects of light pollution on the night sky, but it is quite low-priority when compared to other issues.

#### Personal Experiences:
- Astronomer’s Perspective: The astronomer expressed frustration over light pollution’s impact on stargazing. She expressed wishes for the sky to appear as it had a hundred years ago, and described seeing stars in low-pollution environments as “mind-blowing”. 
- General Public: They expressed general indifference to the impact of light pollution on the night sky. This could be due to the fact that they have not seen the night sky in a low-pollution environment. One interviewee who experienced an earthquake in LA that knocked out most of the power grid and actually saw the night sky in a low-pollution environment expressed much less indifference to the issue. 
#### Impact on Nature and Local Ecosystems:
- Wildlife and Ecosystem Impact: Interviewees were aware that there could be some impacts to animal’s perception of nighttime and daytime. There were also concerns of lights disorienting animals such as deer leading into unsafe interactions.
- Fossil Fuel Consumption: Interviewees also cited lowered use of fossil fuels if light pollution counteractive measures are taken.  
- Comparison to other pollutants: Unlike air or water pollution, which feels like a more personal issue, light pollution feels more distant and harder to tackle, making it harder to prioritize.

#### Reactions to a Potential Light Pollution Awareness App:
- Mixed Interest: While some interviewees would try an app to learn about reducing light pollution, others see limited personal relevance. Social features to connect with other stargazing enthusiasts could increase interest.

### Key Lessons
Even though there seems to be general disinterest, there are chances to raise awareness. One of the interviewees that was not really convinced at first, expressed more interest after the interview talked about personal experiences surrounding light pollution. The interviewer opened up about seeing the night sky after a natural disaster, resulting in an area wide power outage where they were able to see the night sky. This captured the interest of the interviewee who began to sympathize more with the issue. Another interviewee who also experienced an area wide power outage and saw the night sky in a low-pollution environment also expressed a lot of interest. This shows that it is possible to raise awareness.

## Revised Impact Case

1. The problem of light pollution is important because it can negatively interfere with animals’ biological clocks and contributes to unnecessary energy consumption and carbon emissions. Secondly, it makes stargazing more difficult.
2. Our solution to address this problem is to build an app to raise awareness about light pollution. This app will track areas with high levels of light pollution, provide resources to learn more about light pollution, connect people with initiatives to reduce light pollution, and provide stargazing forums for people to meet others interested in the night sky.
3. We believe these are good solutions because in our experience, light pollution isn’t taken very seriously by the general population and isn’t acknowledged much in policy. Raising awareness and increasing involvement in the movement to reduce light pollution are currently the best steps to reduce light pollution. By using community-centric engagement, such as forums and introducing people to initiatives, people will feel connected and more enthusiastic about solving the issue of light pollution.
4. We could measure user engagement metrics and take polls from people in our communities to prove that our app is a good solution to light pollution. We could also have users upload images of the night sky in their area so that we could track visibility of the night sky over time.
