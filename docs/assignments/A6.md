## Task List

| Task Title  | Instruction to User            | Rationale             |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Register and Verify Account**            | "Please sign up for a new account on SafeCircle and complete the identity verification process."                                       | This task tests the **Authenticating** and **Verifying Identity** concepts. It evaluates the ease of the registration process, the clarity of instructions for identity verification, and whether users understand the importance and methods of verifying their identity.                                           |                                                                 |
| **2. Join an Existing Event**                 | "Browse the list of upcoming events and join one that interests you."                                                                                              | This task tests the **Posting** and **Joining** concepts. It assesses how easily users can discover events, understand event details, and successfully join an activity. It also checks the effectiveness of filters or search functions in event discovery.                                                        |
| **3. Create a New Event**                     | "Create a new event at a venue you'd like to host an activity, providing all the necessary details."                                                        | This evaluates the **Posting** concept from the host's perspective. It tests the user's ability to create an event and the clarity of the event creation form.                                                           |
| **4. Enable Real-Time Safety Features**       | "Enable location sharing with a trusted contact."                                              | This checks the **Location Sharing** concept and the real-time safety features. It evaluates whether users can easily find and use safety features, understand their importance, and manage their privacy preferences while feeling secure during events.                                                          |
| **5. Endorse Another User**                   | "After participating in an event, endorse a user you interacted with, highlighting your experience."                                                              | This task tests the **Endorsing** concept. It assesses how intuitive it is for users to provide feedback about others, the steps involved in giving an endorsement, and whether users understand how endorsements contribute to community trust.                                                                  |
| **6. View Received Endorsements**             | "Check your profile to view any endorsements you've received from other users."                                                                                   | This evaluates how users access and interpret the endorsements they've received.

## User Study 1:
In the user study, the participant initially attempted to register for a new account but mistakenly used the login fields instead of the registration form. After about a minute, and before receiving an error message, she realized the mistake and corrected it. This suggests that the distinction between the login and registration interfaces may not be sufficiently clear, causing initial confusion and a minor breakdown in the gulf of execution.

During the registration process, she inquired about a password recovery option, asking, "What if I forget my password?" This indicates that users expect a "Forgot Password" feature, and its absence could lead to concerns about account accessibility, affecting user confidence.

After registering, the participant had to navigate through several pages to find the identity verification section. This implies that the verification process is not prominently displayed or intuitively accessible, potentially hindering users from completing essential steps for full app functionality.

On a positive note, she found joining existing events straightforward, indicating that the event discovery and joining features are user-friendly and well-designed. Similarly, the button to create a new event was easy to locate, suggesting effective placement of primary actions within the interface.

Regarding the calendar page displaying events she had joined, the participant expressed a preference for an actual calendar view with events plotted on specific dates rather than a list format. This suggests that a visual representation could enhance the user experience by providing a clearer overview of scheduled events.

Finally, when posting an event, she preferred having separate input fields for the location and date to prevent users from forgetting to include essential details. This indicates that the current event creation form may not adequately guide users to provide all necessary information, potentially leading to incomplete event listings.

Overall, while key functionalities like joining and creating events are accessible and user-friendly, there are areas for improvement in the registration process, identity verification accessibility, location sharing workflow, and event creation form design. Addressing these issues could significantly enhance the overall user experience.

## User Study 2:

The participant began by easily finding where to register a user and login. However, she encountered difficulty locating the identity verification button. She navigated through the bottom navigation bar from left to right—Home, Browse, Calendar, and Profile—she only found the verification option upon reaching the Profile page. This suggests that the placement of the verification feature is not immediately intuitive, potentially causing confusion for new users unfamiliar with the app's structure.

Similarly, when attempting to find the endorse feature, the participant had to search through all the pages without success at first. Uncertain of its location, she systematically checked each page. This indicates that essential features like endorsement are not prominently displayed or easily discoverable, leading to a breakdown in the user's ability to efficiently navigate and utilize key functionalities.

On a positive note, the participant found browsing events and joining them to be very intuitive. The ease with which she could discover and participate in events highlights the effectiveness of the app's core functionality and user interface design in this area.

However, she experienced difficulty finding where to manage location sharing. Since she hadn't yet accessed the Settings page, she didn't realize that location sharing options were located there. This points to potential issues with the visibility and accessibility of important settings, suggesting that users may benefit from more intuitive pathways to adjust their preferences.

The participant also commented on the lack of distinction between the Home and Browse pages, noting that there isn't much difference between them. She expressed a desire for the Browse page to offer more functionality, such as sorting events by time and category, and the ability to see who else is attending each event. This feedback indicates an opportunity to enhance the event discovery experience by incorporating more advanced filtering options and social features, which could increase user engagement and satisfaction.

She appreciated the colors used in the app, indicating a positive reception of the visual design and overall aesthetic.

Additionally, she suggested combining the Profile and Settings pages to minimize confusion. She believed that consolidating these pages would make it easier to find features like verification and endorsement, improving navigation efficiency.

Lastly, she wondered why the Home button was available in both the bottom and top navigation bars. This redundancy in the navigation structure may lead to confusion, suggesting a need to streamline the navigation to make it more intuitive.

Overall, the participant found event browsing and joining straightforward and praised the app's visual appeal. However, improving feature discoverability, refining the navigation structure, and expanding the functionality of the Browse page could significantly improve the user experience. By addressing these issues, the app can become more user-friendly and better meet the needs of its users.

## Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement

#### 1. Confusion Between Login and Registration Forms

Issue: The participant initially used the login fields to register a new account, leading to confusion. The visual and textual distinction between the login and registration interfaces may not be prominent, causing users to mistake one for the other.

Potential Solutions:
Clearly label the "Login" and "Register" sections with distinct headings.
Use different colors or design elements to differentiate the forms.
Provide a prompt or link near the login form guiding new users to the registration page.

Level: Linguistic (labeling and instructions)

Severity: Moderate

#### 2. Lack of Sorting and Categorization of Events

Issue: The participant noted the absence of options to sort events by time and category, and that events lack categorization. Without sorting and categorization, users may find it difficult to discover events that match their interests or schedules, leading to a less efficient event discovery process.

Potential Solutions:
Implement event categories (e.g., social, professional, hobby-based) that users can select when creating events.
Add sorting and filtering options on the events page to allow users to sort events by date/time, category, popularity, or location.
Provide a search function to enable users to find events based on keywords.

Level: Conceptual (information organization and retrieval)

Severity: Moderate

#### 3. Difficulty Locating Identity Verification

Issue: The participant had to click through multiple pages to find where to verify her identity. The identity verification process is not prominently featured or easily accessible from the main interface.

Potential Solutions:
Add a prominent notification or banner prompting users to verify their identity after registration.
Include a direct link to the verification process on the user homepage.

Level: Conceptual (navigation and information architecture)

Severity: Moderate

#### 4. Event Creation Form Lacking Separate Fields

Issue: The participant preferred separate input fields for location and date when posting an event. A single text area may lead users to omit essential details like location and date, resulting in incomplete event information.

Potential Solutions:
Redesign the event creation form to include dedicated fields for location, date, and time.
Implement form validation to ensure all required fields are filled before submission.
Use placeholder text and labels to guide users on what information is needed.

Level: Physical/Linguistic (form design and field labeling)

Severity: Major
