# Phase 5


## Design Revisions


For badging, our initial outline was to have one section for the badges the user has achieved. However, we realized that the users should know their process on each of the badges, and know how many points they have left. Thus, in the profile section, the user has two options: 1. They can see what badges they have achieved, and 2. They can see the badges in process + the points they have left to achieve it.


For posting, we decided to get rid of the boosting functionality, and in replacement we added two buttons: sort by number of likes and sort by date added. This is because boosting would make the order of the posts somewhat arbitrary, since the sorting was dependent on both date added and the number of likes. We decided to simplify the functionality by adding two separate buttons.


For Mapping, we decided to get rid of the routing functionality. This routing functionality will have had to rely on a novel algorithm we do not have the time to develop. The original intention was to find “light pollution sweet spots” where users in high light pollution areas could find areas with less light pollution that were nearby with ease and get directions to said spot, however this seems very difficult to implement with the current time frame. Instead of reinventing the wheel, users can find a suitable location with less light pollution using the heatmap and just use a routing app such as google or apple maps.


For Foruming, instead of having channels listed on the side, we decided to list the forums below the create forum form. This is because the navbar is already located on the side, so the design would be a bit clunky. Instead, users can scroll through forums on the forum page, and click “enter” to enter a separate page containing the comments of that forum.


## User Testing - Task List


| Task Name | Instruction | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home page navigation | Can you tell me three reasons why light pollution is a problem by navigating the home page? | This task assesses whether the primary purpose of the app—educating users about light pollution—is clear and engaging. It tests the intuitiveness of the home page and content layout. |
| Map navigation | Can you go to the map page and locate a post? | This task evaluates the user's ability to register an account and navigate to the map page and interact with its features. It checks if map navigation is straightforward and the posts are easily locatable. |
| Toggle heatmap | Find the closest dark location from you | This task examines how effectively users can use the heatmap feature to identify dark locations. It highlights any confusion regarding proximity detection or heatmap toggling. |
| Posting | Can you create a post with a suggested hashtag? | This task tests whether users can easily create posts and understand the suggested hashtags feature. It helps assess the clarity and usability of the posting interface. |
| Filtering | What’s the post with the most number of likes? What’s the most recent post? Who posted a post with the hashtag moon? | This task evaluates the filtering capabilities and whether users can retrieve specific posts efficiently. It identifies potential issues in filter discoverability or usability. |
| Badging | Did you start a badge? How many points do you have left? | This task assesses how well users understand the badge system and progress tracking. It uncovers issues in communicating gamification elements clearly. |
| Post to Map | Can you locate your post on the map? Is it in a dark location? | This task evaluates how posts integrate with the map and checks if users can confirm their post's location, validating the connection between posts and dark site identification. |
| Forums | Can you enter a forum and post? | This task tests the intuitiveness of navigating to and interacting within forums. It assesses how well forums are integrated and aligned with user expectations. |
| Locate Space Object | What are the two space objects near you? | This task examines the user’s ability to find and interact with the space object feature. |
