### Concept 1: Authenticating [User] 

State:
```
Users: Set<User>
Credentials: Mapping<User, {username, password}>
 ```
Instantiation: `AuthenticatingConcept<User>`
 

### Concept 2: Sessioning [User]

State:
```
Sessions: Mapping<SessionID, {user: User, expiryTime: Timestamp}>
 ```
 Instantiation: `SessioningConcept<User>`

### Concept 3: Verifying Identity [User]

State:
```
VerificationStatus: Mapping<U, {status: VerificationState}>
VerificationDataStore: Mapping<U, VerificationData>

## Reflection
One ambiguity was determining the mechanics of location sharing. I was uncertain about how to represent and encode location data, so I explored various options and opted for using longitude and latitude coordinates. This decision streamlined the implementation process, avoiding the complexity of integrating with external applications and ensuring precise geographical representation. Another issue pertained to the management of trusted contacts. The original design lacked clarity on who could be designated as a trusted contact. To simplify development, I restricted the trusted contact list to users within the application. This approach creates easier management of permissions and enhances security by limiting access to verified users only.
The user verification process also presented challenges. My initial design included two verification methods: government-issued IDs and LinkedIn authentication. However, integrating LinkedIn proved overly complicated due to OAuth complexities and inconsistent data handling. Consequently, I chose to do the verification process by exclusively utilizing government ID verification.
