# Does the school education system lead to functional fixedness in adulthood?

After Wednesday's lecture, I was thinking about why the cognitive bias of functional fixedness is so prevalent among people. It's intriguing to consider how adults often develop a fixed way of thinking, contrasted by the imaginative flexibility commonly seen in children. 

I still remember, as kids, my friends and I would invent variations of games and scenarios, using the same toys for countless different purposes. A simple box would be transformed into a fort, a treasure chest, or a spaceship, depending on what we were playing. This uninhibited imagination seems in stark contrast to the fixedness observed in adult reasoning. As children grow and enter formal education systems, thereâ€™s a significant shift towards standardized testing and structured learning. The focus often moves from creative exploration to "right" answers and specific ways of accomplishing tasks. This shift can be seen as a root of functional fixedness, where students learn to conform to specific instructions and methods, which can limit their ability to think outside the box as they transition into adulthood.

In many school systems, a heavy emphasis on standardization may inadvertently promote functional fixedness. By encouraging conformity and discouraging deviation from standard procedures, schools may stifle the creative problem-solving skills that are vital in real-world scenarios. This rigid approach often overlooks the value of exploring multiple methods and solutions, which can hinder the development of flexible thinking.

Another critical component of learning through exploration and experimentation is play. As schooling becomes more serious, there is less time and encouragement for play, potentially leading to a decline in innovative thinking skills as children grow. The decrease in playtime reduces opportunities for children to solve problems creatively, which may lead to more fixed approaches to challenges.

I believe the schooling system may be a significant factor in contributing to the development of functional fixedness. One idea to combat this is to encourage creative problem solving. Schools can incorporate more open-ended problems in their curricula that allow for multiple solutions, encouraging students to think creatively and flexibly. By shifting the focus from finding the "one right answer" to exploring a variety of solutions, educators can help nurture a generation of thinkers who can look beyond the conventional uses of objects and ideas.
